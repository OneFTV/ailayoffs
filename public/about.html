<h1>About <span class="red">AILayoff.live</span></h1>

<div class="card">
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>AILayoff.live exists to provide transparent, real-time tracking of AI-driven job displacement worldwide. We believe the workforce impact of artificial intelligence deserves the same rigorous, data-first tracking that COVID-19 received from Worldometer.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Independence</h3>
<p>We are fully independent and not affiliated with any technology company, staffing agency, or political organization. Our data speaks for itself — we don't advocate for or against AI adoption. We simply track what's happening.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<ul class="bullets">
<li><strong>Data-first:</strong> Every number is sourced and classified by confidence level</li>
<li><strong>Transparent:</strong> Methodology and sources are fully documented</li>
<li><strong>Real-time:</strong> Updated daily with breaking events added within hours</li>
<li><strong>Global:</strong> Tracking displacement across 48+ countries</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Inspired by trackers like Worldometer and layoffs.fyi, we saw the need for a dedicated platform focused specifically on AI's impact on employment — not just tech layoffs in general, but the specific displacement caused by AI and automation technologies.</p>
